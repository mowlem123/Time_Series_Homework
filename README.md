## Volatility Forecasting with GARCH
    -1. GARCH: Create an GARCH model and fit it to the returns data. Note: Set the parameters to p=2 and q=1: order=(2, 1).
    -2. Output the GARCH summary table and take note of the p-values of the lags. Based on the p-values, is the model a good fit (p < 0.05)?
    -3. Plot the 5-day forecast of the volatility.
# Conclusions
  - Based on your time series analysis, would you buy the yen now?
  - Is the risk of the yen expected to increase or decrease?
  - Based on the model evaluation, would you feel confident in using these models for trading?
